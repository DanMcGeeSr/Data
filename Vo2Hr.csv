Measuring energy expenditure is difficult outside the laboratory.,
 Surrogate measures are sought.  One possible surrogate is heart rate.,
,
These data come from an experiment  ran at LUMC,
The question was whether heart rate as measured by a portable monitor was a good indicator of energy expenditure,
"The gold standard for energy expenditure is oxygen expendature, but that is very expense to measure.",
It requires wearing an air tight mask.,
,
Each of a group of graduate students was given tasks that required differing levels of effort.,
each of the group wore the oxygen masks and a pulse rate monitor and the measurements were made at the same time.,
